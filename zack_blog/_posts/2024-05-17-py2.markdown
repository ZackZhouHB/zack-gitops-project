<b> About Python File Handling</b>

In last post I list some Python Boto3 scripts for AWS resource automation and management, in this post I will continue with Python to discuss file handling. 

As sometime I got a csv file with list of EC2 instances and its properties, when I need to modify or apply the data within the file to AWS, I need to be able to process and handle file (csv or json). hence I think it is necessary to get a deep understanding of Python file handling.

So I will use the portable python3.9 + Boto3 docker environment to test some file handling tasks. 

<b> Build and run a docker with Python3.9 + Boto3 </b>

{% highlight shell %}
{% endhighlight %}

<b> Conclusion</b>

Now we can use Python Boto3 script for AWS resource management and file handling. Next post I will discuss how to use Python for Web application development.
