<b> The Replication</b>

Last post I started hands on session with PostgreSQL installation on both docker and docker compose, explore configuration and presis volume. 

In this post I will setup a second PostgreSQL instance to see how to configure the first PostgreSQL instance to replicate its data to the second instance, so the failover can be tested. 

By achieving this, steps can be followed by:  

- Get Primary PostgreSQL up and running

- Setup docker network and Create Replication User

- Enable Write-Ahead Log, archive and Replication

- Take a base backup

- Start standby instance

- Test the replication

- Test Failover

<b> Conclusion</b>

Now we are able to run a PostgreSQL primary and standby instances to test replication and failover, in the next blog I will discover how to run PostgreSQL on kubernetes with both Helm and operater, then validate scale up and down, backup using cronjob and etc.
