<b>Professional Summary</b>:

I am a seasoned IT professional with over a decade of experience, characterized by continuous evolution and mastery across diverse technological domains. My career began at Lenovo, a Fortune Global 500 company, where I developed a strong foundation in traditional IT, gaining comprehensive expertise in hardware, databases, operating systems, and SAP applications. This experience provided me with a robust understanding of enterprise-level IT ecosystems.

Since relocating to Australia in 2017, I have broadened my professional ICT expertise in cinema and public sector. At `EVENT Cinemas`, I transitioned to cloud computing, focusing on AWS cloud platforms and DevOps practices. My role involved implementing cost optimization strategies and leading digital transformations, which enhanced organizational agility and expanded cloud footprints. Currently, as a Senior DevOps Engineer at the `NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA)`, I specialize in AWS cloud infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes deployments, and serverless migrations. I have also ventured into machine learning operations (MLOps), automating the provisioning and deployment of machine learning models on AWS.

With extensive cloud and DevOps experience, I possess proven expertise in Kubernetes orchestration, CI/CD pipeline development, and serverless architecture. My strong capabilities in automation through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like CloudFormation, Terraform, and Ansible have enabled me to streamline infrastructure provisioning and dynamic management. I hold several industry-recognized certifications, including `AWS Certified Solutions Architect`, `AWS Certified DevOps Engineer`, `CNCF Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)`, `CNCF Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist (CKS)`, and `RedHat Certified Engineer (RHCE)`.
