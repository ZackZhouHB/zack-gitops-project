<b>Professional Summary</b>:

I consider myself as a seasoned IT professional with a rich and versatile career spanning over a decade, marked by a continuous evolution and mastery of diverse technological domains. 

Commencing in a prestigious Global 500 company Lenovo back in 2011, I acquired comprehensive expertise in traditional IT, encompassing hardware, databases, operating systems, and SAP applications. This foundational experience provided a robust understanding of enterprise-level IT ecosystems.

When family moved to Australia in 2017, I joined a foreign back in Sydney. 3 years as system administrator I immersed myself in VMware technologies, expanding my skill set from traditional IT to virtualization environment include Microsoft Active Directory and comprehensive system administration tasks. This pivotal phase equipped me with a holistic view of infrastructure management, laying the groundwork for my progression into the realm of cloud computing.

My foray into AWS marked a pivotal shift towards cloud solutions design and operation when I started new journey in EVENT cinema in 2020. Playing a key role in architecting scalable and secure cloud infrastructures, I contributed to the digital transformation of organizations. This experience also ignited my journey into the agile software development lifecycle, where I learned to harmonize development and operations through automation and the design and maintenance of robust CI/CD pipelines.

Embracing contemporary trends, I delved into microservices architecture and Kubernetes (K8S) by implementing EVENT's first K8S installation and microservice deployment in 2023. This venture into modern cloud-native technologies underscores my passion and commitment to staying at the forefront of industry advancements.
